# klipper-sovol-skr-e3-v2
Klipper configuration for stock Sovol SV01 printer with Bigtreetech SKR mini E3 v2.0 board

Could not find any configuration for this combo online, so I made my own.

This configuration is based on the SKR mini E3 v2.0 config at the Klipper repo:
https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/config/generic-bigtreetech-skr-mini-e3-v2.0.cfg

I have modified it so that it works with (otherwise) stock Sovol SV-01.

Comments and improvements are welcome! I'll update them (and mine) here.
